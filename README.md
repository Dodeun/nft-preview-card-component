## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### Continued development

- Try and use more class selectors in my sass instead of elements like p , div ... (Research if it realy is the way to go)

- Decide between a hierachic/descriptiv base naming of my color variables (primary, secondary, links ...) or a color base one (red, red-light, red-dark, green ...) or find how to use both.
